## Ticketing Dashboard and list Vue 3 

npm install 

npm run dev

### What I would do more

Frontend Improvements
- Add more charts/visualizations for analytics.

- Implement advanced search and filtering with debounce + API-side filtering.

- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

- Add more filtering and sorting via column, created date, assigniee 

Testing

- Add end-to-end tests (e.g., Cypress or Playwright) to cover critical flows.
